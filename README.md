I am a Data Scientist with 4 years of experience.

In these 4 years, I have had the opportunity to be a team leader in the development of web platforms. Every project that Iâ€™ve been part of all came around as a success story (6 projects); I worked with TypeScript, React, Express, NodeJs, Swagger, Jest, Heroku, MongoDB, and their tools used for the development of apps and web pages.

Due to the experience gained with deadlines, Scrum methodology, working with limited time and objectives helped me and encouraged me to give my best.ðŸš€

Below you can learn more about me, my development, and contributions.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Genium](https://www.genium.io) 
     
  Genium is a premier software engineering and agile consulting firm (Headquartered in Silicon Valley), that connects innovative companies with developers,  engineers, and security experts.
  
I am grateful to be part of the team, every day I share and learn too many things with them, and having the opportunity to connect with smart and great people is really cool.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better coder and more technologies like Deno, GraphQl, Solidity, and NFTs.

   I am passionate about technology and learning new things. I study to be better every day and push the limits, because for me this career never stops expanding and that's why, if anyone knows me, you know how much I like to inform myself and try to learn more about new things.
