I am a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience.
In these 3 years, I have had the opportunity to be a team leader for the development of web platforms. Every project that Iâ€™ve been part of all came around as success stories; I worked with TypeScript, React, Express, NodeJs, Swagger, Jest, Heroku, MongoDB, and their tools used for the development of apps and web pages.
Due to the experience gained with deadlines, Scrum methodology, working with limited time and objectives helps me and encourages me to give my best.ðŸš€

Below you can learn more about me, my development, contributions, and my specialties.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Asamblo](https://asamblo.com/) 
     
   In my opinion one of the best companies in Argentina where a coder will see his limits and understand the impact of his code on communities around the globe. I'm totally thankful for the opportunity and to be part of this team. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better coder and more technologies like Deno, GraphQl, Meteor, and Zilliqa.

   I passionate the technology and at this moment maybe are only 4 new techs I study to be better but these are not the limit because for me this career never stops to expand and this is why -if someone knows me, know- how much I like study and try to learn more about new things.
