I am a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience.
In these 3 years, I have had the opportunity to be a team leader for the development of web platforms. Every project that Iâ€™ve been part of all came around as success stories; I worked with TypeScript, React, Express, NodeJs, Swagger, Jest, Heroku, MongoDB, and their tools used for the development of apps and web pages.
Due to the experience gained with deadlines, Scrum methodology, working with limited time and objectives helped me and encouraged me to give my best.ðŸš€

Below you can learn more about me, my development, and contributions.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Asamblo](https://asamblo.com/) 
     
   This is one of the best companies in Argentina where a coder will see his limits and understand the impact of his code on communities around the globe. I'm totally grateful for the opportunity to be part of this team. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better coder and more technologies like Deno, GraphQl, Meteor, and Zilliqa.

   I'm passionate about technology and learning new thing. I study to be better everyday and pushing the limits, because for me this career never stops to expand and this is why, if someone knows me, they know how much I like to study and try to learn more about new things.
