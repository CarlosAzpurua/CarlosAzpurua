### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Asamblo[https://asamblo.com/] 
     
    In my opinion one of the best companies in Argentina where a coder will see his limits and understand the impact of his code on communities around the globe. I'm totally thankful for the opportunity and to be part of this team. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better coder and more technologies like Deno, GraphQl, Meteor, and Zilliqa.

    I passionate the technology and at this moment maybe are only 4 new techs I study to be better but these are not the limit because for me this career never stops to expand and this is why -if someone knows me, know- how much I like study and try to learn more about new things. 
    
  - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on SSI Protocol or SSI Tyron[https://www.ssiprotocol.com/#/]
